# Configx (Dotfiles)

This repository contains my dotfiles. Most of the configurations are managed through [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager).
Using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and [Home-Manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager) makes it easy to manage your system. Home-Manager, in particular, simplifies the management of your dotfiles at a user level rather than a system level.
